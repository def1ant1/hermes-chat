# @hermeslabs/electron-client-ipc

This package is a client-side toolkit for handling IPC (Inter-Process Communication) in Hermes Chat's Electron environment.

> \[!IMPORTANT] Hermes Labs Scope Migration
>
> - **Effective date:** 2025-03-31 ‚Äì install with `npm install @hermeslabs/electron-client-ipc` to stay within the supported namespace.
> - **Compatibility window:** Deprecation shims for `@hermeslabs/electron-client-ipc` remain available until 2025-09-30; deployments pinned to the legacy scope must transition before then.
> - **Rollback path:** Reference the [Hermes rebranding rollback guidance](https://github.com/hermeslabs/hermes-chat/blob/main/docs/development/rebranding.md#rollback-strategy) if you need to revert for emergency hotfixes.
> - **Breaking-change watch-outs:** Renderer bundles that tree-shake by package name require cache invalidation after changing the import scope.

## Introduction

In Electron applications, IPC (Inter-Process Communication) serves as a bridge connecting the Main Process, Renderer Process, and NextJS Process. To better organize and manage these communications, we have split the IPC-related code into two packages:

- `@hermeslabs/electron-client-ipc`: **Client-side IPC package**
- `@hermeslabs/electron-server-ipc`: **Server-side IPC package**

## Key Differences

### electron-client-ipc (This Package)

- Runtime Environment: Runs in the Renderer Process
- Main Responsibilities:
  - Provides interface definitions for renderer process to call main process methods
  - Encapsulates `ipcRenderer.invoke` related methods
  - Handles communication requests with the main process

### electron-server-ipc

- Runtime Environment: Runs in both Electron main process and Next.js server process
- Main Responsibilities:
  - Provides Socket-based IPC communication mechanism
  - Implements server-side (ElectronIPCServer) and client-side (ElectronIpcClient) communication components
  - Handles cross-process requests and responses
  - Provides automatic reconnection and error handling mechanisms
  - Ensures type-safe API calls

## Use Cases

When the renderer process needs to:

- Access system APIs
- Perform file operations
- Call main process specific functions

All such operations need to be initiated through the methods provided by the `electron-client-ipc` package.

## Technical Notes

This separated package design follows the principle of separation of concerns, ensuring that:

- IPC communication interfaces are clear and maintainable
- Client-side and server-side code are decoupled
- TypeScript type definitions are shared, ensuring type safety

## ü§ù Contribution

IPC communication needs vary across different use cases and platforms. We welcome community contributions to improve and extend the IPC functionality. You can participate in improvements through:

### How to Contribute

1. **Bug Reports**: Report issues with IPC communication or type definitions
2. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new IPC methods or improvements to existing interfaces
3. **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests for bug fixes or new features

### Contribution Process

1. Fork the [Hermes Chat repository](https://github.com/hermeslabs/hermes-chat)
2. Make your changes to the IPC client package
3. Submit a Pull Request describing:

- The problem being solved
- Implementation details
- Test cases or usage examples
- Impact on existing functionality
