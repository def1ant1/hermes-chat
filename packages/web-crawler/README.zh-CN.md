# @hermeslabs/web-crawler (Global Edition)

This package provides Hermes Chat with a compliant, rate-aware crawling engine for collecting public web content before enrichment and indexing.

> \[!IMPORTANT] Hermes Labs Scope Migration
>
> - **Effective date:** 2025-03-31 ‚Äì install via `npm install @hermeslabs/web-crawler` to adopt the supported namespace.
> - **Compatibility window:** `@hermeslabs/web-crawler` receives compatibility updates through 2025-09-30 so you can roll out migrations gradually.
> - **Rollback path:** Use the [Hermes rebranding rollback guidance](https://github.com/hermeslabs/hermes-chat/blob/main/docs/development/rebranding.md#rollback-strategy) if a production incident requires reverting to the legacy package scope.
> - **Breaking-change considerations:** Infrastructure automation (CI/CD, container images, scheduler jobs) must update pinned dependencies concurrently to avoid crawl job failures.

## Overview

`@hermeslabs/web-crawler` is engineered to fetch, clean, and normalize web pages while respecting robots directives and tenant-specific rate limits.

## Key Features

- **Policy Compliance:** Honors robots.txt rules and domain-level restrictions.
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Dynamically adjusts concurrency to respect provider SLAs.
- **Content Normalization:** Strips scripts, deduplicates whitespace, and extracts metadata for downstream processing.
- **Observability Hooks:** Emits structured logs and metrics for centralized monitoring platforms.

import { createCrawler } from '@hermeslabs/web-crawler';

const crawler = createCrawler({
  concurrency: 4,

await crawler.crawl('https://example.com/docs');
```
