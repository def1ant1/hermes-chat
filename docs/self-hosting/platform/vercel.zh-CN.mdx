# Deploy Hermes Chat with Vercel

Follow this enterprise-ready checklist to launch Hermes Chat on Vercel with high confidence:

> \[!IMPORTANT] Hermes Labs Scope Migration
>
> - **Effective date:** 2025-03-31 â€“ all deployment templates and starter projects now pull packages from the `@hermeslabs/*` namespace to align with the centralized registry.
> - **Compatibility window:** Legacy `@lobechat/*` and `@hermeslabs/*` packages receive hotfix updates until 2025-09-30 so you can stage blue/green rollouts or orchestrate emergency downgrades.
> - **Rollback path:** Follow the [rebranding rollback playbook](/docs/development/rebranding#rollback-strategy) and trigger Vercel's "Redeploy" action against the previous commit when you need to revert the scope migration.
> - **Breaking-change considerations:** Update any Vercel integration still targeting the `lobehub/lobe-chat` repository to `hermeslabs/hermes-chat` before the compatibility window closes; otherwise automated deploys will fail once the legacy repo is archived.

## Vercel Deployment Process

<Steps>
  ### Prepare your OpenAI API Key

  Retrieve a key from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and store it in your enterprise secrets manager before pasting it into Vercel.

  ### Click the button below to deploy

  [![][deploy-button-image]][deploy-link]

  Authenticate with GitHub, populate `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) on the environment variables step, and confirm the repository import completes successfully.

  ### After deployment, you can start using the workspace

  ### Bind a custom domain (optional)

  DNS for the default Vercel domain can be filtered in certain regions. Mapping a custom domain ensures reliable global connectivity.
</Steps>

## Automatic Synchronization of Updates

Projects created from the one-click deployment template operate as independent repositories, so Vercel cannot detect upstream changes automatically. As a result, you may see persistent "updates available" prompts.

<Callout>
  Reprovision following the [Self-Hosting Upstream Sync](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/upstream-sync)
  instructions to attach your deployment to the primary `hermeslabs/hermes-chat` repository and inherit future automation.
