# Deploy Hermes Chat with Vercel

If you want to deploy Hermes Chat on Vercel, you can follow the steps below:

> \[!IMPORTANT] Hermes Labs Scope Migration
>
> - **Effective date:** 2025-03-31 – deployment templates now pull packages under the `@hermeslabs/*` scope to ensure consistency with the Hermes Labs registry.
> - **Compatibility window:** The legacy `@lobechat/*` Docker images and npm packages stay updated until 2025-09-30 for rollback or staggered region releases.
> - **Rollback path:** Use the [rebranding rollback flow](/docs/development/rebranding#rollback-strategy) and redeploy via Vercel’s "Redeploy" action with the prior commit to undo the scope migration.
> - **Breaking-change watch-outs:** Existing Vercel projects pinned to the `lobehub/lobe-chat` repository must update their Git integration to the new `hermeslabs/hermes-chat` repo before the compatibility window ends to avoid auto-deploy failures.

## Vercel Deployment Process

<Steps>
  ### Prepare your OpenAI API Key

  Go to [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to get your OpenAI API Key.

  ### Click the button below to deploy

  Simply log in with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) in the environment variables page.

  ### After deployment, you can start using it

  ### Bind a custom domain (optional)

  Vercel's assigned domain DNS may be polluted in some regions, so binding a custom domain can establish a direct connection.
</Steps>

## Automatic Synchronization of Updates

If you have deployed your project using the one-click deployment steps mentioned above, you may find that you are always prompted with "updates available." This is because Vercel creates a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, which causes the inability to accurately detect updates.

  We recommend following the [Self-Hosting Upstream Sync](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/upstream-sync)
  steps to Redeploy.
