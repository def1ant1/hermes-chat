# Build Your Own Hermes Chat

Hermes Chat supports various deployment platforms, including Vercel, Docker, and Docker Compose. You can choose a deployment platform that suits you to build your own Hermes Chat.

## Quick Deployment

For users who are new to Hermes Chat, we recommend using the client-side database mode for quick deployment. The advantage of this mode is that deployment can be quickly completed with just one command/button, making it easy for you to quickly get started and experience Hermes Chat.

You can follow the guide below for quick deployment of Hermes Chat:

  In the client-side database mode, data is stored locally on the user's device, without
  cross-device synchronization, and does not support advanced features such as file uploads and
  knowledge base.
</Callout>

## Advanced Mode: Server-Side Database

For users who are already familiar with Hermes Chat or need cross-device synchronization, you can deploy a version with a server-side database to access a more complete and powerful Hermes Chat.
